The Terraform CLI (Command Line Interface) provides a comprehensive set of commands designed to manage the lifecycle of your infrastructure in a structured and predictable manner. The CLI is divided into main commands that cover the primary workflow for managing infrastructure with Terraform, as well as additional commands for more advanced or less common tasks. Below is a detailed overview of these commands and their primary use cases, along with global options that modify the behavior of Terraform commands.

### Main Commands

- **`init`**: Initializes a new or existing Terraform configuration by preparing the working directory for other commands. This includes downloading provider plugins, initializing backends, and setting up modules.

- **`validate`**: Checks the configuration for syntax errors and internal consistency. This command does not access any remote services.

- **`plan`**: Creates an execution plan, showing what Terraform will do to change the infrastructure from its current state to the state described in the configuration. This command is a key part of the Terraform workflow, allowing for review and adjustment before changes are applied.

- **`apply`**: Executes the actions proposed in a Terraform plan. This command is used to create or update infrastructure according to the Terraform configuration and the plan generated by `terraform plan`.

- **`destroy`**: Removes all resources defined in the Terraform configuration. This command is used to tear down the infrastructure managed by Terraform, effectively undoing all actions performed by `terraform apply`.

### All Other Commands

- **`console`**: Provides an interactive console for evaluating Terraform expressions, useful for debugging and understanding Terraform data structures.

- **`fmt`**: Automatically formats Terraform configuration files to a canonical format and style, improving readability and consistency across configurations.

- **`force-unlock`**: Manually releases a stuck lock on the current workspace. This can be necessary if an operation was interrupted and left the state lock in place.

- **`get`**: Downloads and installs modules required for the configuration. This command is usually automatically run by `terraform init`, but can be run manually to update modules.

- **`graph`**: Generates a visual representation of either the configuration or execution plan in DOT format, which can be used to understand the dependencies within the configuration. `terraform graph | dot -Tsvg > graph.svg`

- **`import`**: Brings real-world infrastructure into Terraform management by mapping an existing resource to a Terraform resource in the configuration.

- **`login`**: Obtains and saves credentials for a Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise host, facilitating authenticated interactions with remote backends.

- **`logout`**: Removes locally-stored credentials for a Terraform Cloud or Terraform Enterprise host.

- **`metadata`**: A placeholder for future commands related to Terraform Cloud and Terraform Enterprise metadata.

- **`output`**: Displays the output values from the Terraform state, useful for scripting and integration with other systems.

- **`providers`**: Shows information about the providers required by the current configuration, including versions and source addresses.

- **`refresh`**: Updates the Terraform state to reflect the real-world resources, ensuring the state matches the actual infrastructure.

- **`show`**: Provides human-readable output from a state or plan file, offering insights into the current or proposed state of the infrastructure.

- **`state`**: A collection of subcommands for advanced state management, allowing for manipulation and inspection of the Terraform state.

- **`taint`**: Marks a resource instance as tainted, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated on the next apply, useful for forcing updates to resources.

- **`test`**: Executes integration tests defined within Terraform modules, helping ensure module behavior meets expectations.

- **`untaint`**: Removes the 'tainted' status from a resource instance, reversing the effect of `terraform taint`.

- **`version`**: Displays the current Terraform version, useful for debugging and ensuring compatibility with Terraform configurations and modules.

- **`workspace`**: Manages workspaces, which allow for managing separate states for the same configuration, useful for isolating environments within the same infrastructure setup.

### Global Options

- **`-chdir=DIR`**: Changes to a different directory before executing the given subcommand. This is useful for managing Terraform configurations in different directories without changing the current working directory.

- **`-help`**: Shows help information for the Terraform CLI or for a specific subcommand, providing guidance on command usage and options.

- **`-version`**: An alias for the `version` command, allowing for quick access to Terraform's version information.
