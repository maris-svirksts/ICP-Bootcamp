You'll need your Snowflake account identifier, user name, and role, along with a private key for authentication. Ensure your account has the necessary permissions to create and manage databases, warehouses, schemas, roles, and tables.

### Configuration Files

- **`terraform.tfvars`**: Before running Terraform commands, you must create a `terraform.tfvars` file for the Snowflake configuration, based on the provided `terraform.tfvars.example` file. This file should contain your specific configuration values, such as your Snowflake account details.

## 4. Getting Started

To streamline the deployment of your Snowflake and AWS S3 infrastructure, this project utilizes a `start.sh` script. This script simplifies the initialization, planning, and applying of Terraform configurations. Here's how to get started with this automated setup:

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites
Ensure Terraform and the AWS CLI are installed on your system. Verify their installation by executing `terraform -v` and `aws --version` in your terminal to confirm.

### Step 2: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local environment. Use the command below, substituting `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of the project repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd into_the_project_directory
```

### Step 3: Configure AWS CLI
Configure the AWS CLI with your credentials to allow Terraform to interact with your AWS account. This is achieved by executing `aws configure` and following the prompts to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and default region.

### Step 4: Prepare Snowflake Credentials
Gather your Snowflake credentials, including the account identifier, user, role, and a private key for authentication. These credentials are vital for the Terraform Snowflake provider configuration.

### Step 5: Create Terraform Variable Files
Based on the `terraform.tfvars.example` provided within the `Snowflake` directory, create a `terraform.tfvars` file with your specific configuration values for both Snowflake and AWS settings. This step personalizes the Terraform deployment to suit your environment.

### Step 6: Execute `start.sh` Script
With your environment prepared and variables configured, you are now ready to initiate the infrastructure deployment. Navigate to the root of the project directory and execute the `start.sh` script:

```bash
./start.sh <s3-bucket-name>
```

Ensure that `<s3-bucket-name>` adheres to the AWS S3 bucket naming constraints.

The `start.sh` script automates the following actions:
- Initializes the Terraform workspace for both Snowflake and AWS S3 configurations.
- Reviews the Terraform plan to outline the resources that will be created or modified.
- Applies the Terraform configuration to provision the specified resources taking into account the workspace it's on.

### Step 7: Verify Deployment
After the script completes, verify the deployment by checking the Terraform output and logging into your AWS and Snowflake consoles to see the newly created resources.

### Step 8: Execute `destroy.sh` Script
With your environment prepared and variables configured, you are now ready to initiate the infrastructure deployment. Navigate to the root of the project directory and execute the `start.sh` script:

```bash
./destroy.sh
```

The `destroy.sh` script automates the following actions:
- Destroys the created resources. You will be prompted to confirm each destroy action.

## 5. Usage

### 5.1 Starting the Project with `start.sh` and S3 Bucket Naming Constraints

The `start.sh` script is crucial for initiating the infrastructure setup process, specifically focusing on AWS S3 configurations. It is important to note that S3 bucket names have specific naming conventions that must be followed to ensure successful creation and integration.

**S3 Bucket Naming Constraints:**
- **Lowercase Requirement:** Bucket names must be in lowercase. Uppercase characters are not allowed.
- **Alphanumeric and Hyphens:** Only lowercase alphanumeric characters and hyphens (`-`) are permitted. Spaces, underscores (`_`), and other special characters are not allowed.
- **Unique Names:** The bucket name must be globally unique across all existing bucket names in Amazon S3.

**To run the `start.sh` script:**

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project's root directory.
2. Execute the script by passing a compliant S3 bucket name as an argument:

    ```bash
    ./start.sh <s3-bucket-name>
    ```

Ensure that `<s3-bucket-name>` adheres to the AWS S3 bucket naming constraints mentioned above.

**Functionality of the `start.sh` Script:**

- Proceeds with Terraform initialization and applies the configurations, utilizing the provided S3 bucket name for related AWS S3 resources.

**Example Usage:**

```bash
./start.sh my-project-s3-bucket
```

In this example, `my-project-s3-bucket` is a placeholder for your actual S3 bucket name, which must be in lowercase, contain only alphanumeric characters and hyphens, and be unique across AWS.

**Best Practices for Using `start.sh`**

- **Compliance:** Ensure the S3 bucket name provided to the script strictly follows AWS's naming conventions to avoid errors during the bucket creation process.
- **Preparation:** Before running the script, double-check that your AWS CLI configuration has appropriate access rights to create and manage S3 buckets.

### 5.2 Destroying the Infrastructure

The `destroy.sh` script is designed to safely remove all resources created by Terraform. This is useful for cleaning up the environment or preparing for a fresh deployment.

**To use the script:**

1. Ensure you are in the root directory of the project.
2. Run the following command:

    ```bash
    ./destroy.sh
    ```

The script will:
- Navigate to each Terraform configuration directory.
- Execute `terraform destroy` to remove all resources.

Example command to destroy resources:

```bash
./destroy.sh
```

**Best Practices for Usage**

- **Backup Data**: Ensure that any important data stored in S3 buckets or Snowflake databases is backed up before running the `destroy.sh` script.
