Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows users to access multiple terminal sessions inside a single window. It's particularly useful for remote work, allowing sessions to remain active even after disconnecting, and for organizing workspaces with several terminal sessions. Tmux sessions are made up of windows, and windows can be split into panes, providing a robust environment for multitasking directly from the terminal.

Below is a Markdown document that outlines a basic tmux cheat sheet, including commands for session management, window and pane manipulation, and other useful shortcuts.

# Tmux Cheat Sheet

## Getting Started with Tmux

- **Start a new session:**

  Optionally, you can name your session for easier management:
  ```

  ```

## Session Management

- **Detach from a session:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then `d`.
- **List sessions:**
  ```
  tmux ls
  ```
- **Attach to a session:**
  ```
  tmux attach -t session_name
  ```
- **Kill a session:**
  ```
  tmux kill-session -t session_name
  ```

## Window Management

- **Create a new window:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then `c`.
- **Switch between windows:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then `n` (next) or `p` (previous).
- **Rename the current window:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then `,`.
- **Close the current window:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then `&`.

## Pane Management

- **Split window vertically:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then `%`.
- **Split window horizontally:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then `"`.
- **Switch between panes:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then use the arrow keys.
- **Resize panes:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then hold `Ctrl` while using the arrow keys to adjust.

  Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+d`.

## Miscellaneous

- **Scroll through pane history:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then `[`, use arrow keys to scroll, and press `q` to exit scroll mode.
- **Synchronize input to all panes in a window:**
  Press `Ctrl+b` then `:` and type `setw synchronize-panes on` to enable. To disable, use `off` instead of `on`.

## Customization

Tmux is highly customizable. Configuration can be done in the `.tmux.conf` file located in your home directory. You can set key bindings, appearance, and behavior to suit your preferences.
